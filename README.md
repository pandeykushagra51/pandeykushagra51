### üß© Node.js Core Contributions ‚Äî HTTP/2 Internals

#### ‚úÖ Contribution #1: Graceful Shutdown of HTTP/2 Sessions  
**PR:** [#57611 ‚Äì Implement graceful shutdown of HTTP/2 server sessions with proper GOAWAY handling](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57611)

**Key Changes:**
- Introduced `kSessions` symbol and a `SafeSet` to track active `Http2Session` instances.
- Added a `closeAllSessions()` helper to terminate sessions cleanly.
- Updated `Http2Server.close()` and `Http2SecureServer.close()` to:
  - Send GOAWAY frames.
  - Wait for in-flight streams to finish before closing.
- Refactored failing tests to align with new lifecycle.
- Ensured compliance with [RFC 7540 ¬ß9.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-9.1) and `.close()` behavior parity with HTTP/1.

**Impact:**
- Prevents hanging processes due to lingering HTTP/2 sessions during shutdown.
- Properly rejects new streams after shutdown is initiated.
- Improves server stability and resource cleanup in production environments.
- Introduces a breaking change that aligns behavior with spec and expectations.

**Why It Matters:**  
This fix resolves a long-standing issue where HTTP/2 servers in Node.js couldn't shut down cleanly‚Äîcritical for production workloads like gRPC and streaming APIs. Improves system reliability and protocol compliance.

---

#### ‚úÖ Contribution #2: Fix Premature Session Termination on Empty Responses  
**PR:** [#57808 ‚Äì Fix premature termination of HTTP/2 sessions when sending empty payload responses](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57808)

**Key Changes:**
- Deferred socket destruction until GOAWAY + headers were fully flushed by `nghttp2`.
- Used `nghttp2_session_want_write/read` to manage shutdown safely.
- Added callback-based finalization strategy between JS and C++ layers.
- Identified and fixed race conditions in flaky test `test-http2-client-rststream-before-connect.js`.

**Impact:**
- Guarantees reliable GOAWAY and header delivery for edge cases (e.g., empty responses).
- Improves lifecycle stability and test reliability across platforms.
- Enhances HTTP/2 compliance and eliminates silent failures.

**Why It Matters:**  
Fixed a subtle but critical issue where GOAWAY and headers were silently dropped‚Äîespecially for empty responses. This strengthens Node.js‚Äôs networking layer for high-reliability environments and makes tests more deterministic.
