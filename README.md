üåê Open Source
üß© Node.js Core Contributions ‚Äî HTTP/2 Internals
‚úÖ Contribution #1: Graceful Shutdown of HTTP/2 Sessions
PR: Implement graceful shutdown of HTTP/2 server sessions with proper GOAWAY handling (#57611)

üîß Key Changes:

Introduced kSessions symbol and a SafeSet to track active Http2Session instances.

Added a closeAllSessions() helper to iterate and terminate all sessions cleanly.

Updated Http2Server.close() and Http2SecureServer.close() to:

Send GOAWAY frames before closing.

Wait for in-flight streams to complete.

Refactored and fixed failing tests to align with the new shutdown lifecycle.

Ensured compliance with RFC 7540 ¬ß9.1 and HTTP/1 .close() semantics.

üìà Impact:

Prevents process hangs caused by lingering HTTP/2 sessions.

Enforces proper GOAWAY signaling and rejection of new streams post-shutdown.

Improves server resource cleanup and stability in production.

Introduces a breaking change, but aligns implementation with expected behavior.

üí° Why It Matters:
This fix addresses a long-standing issue where Node.js HTTP/2 servers couldn't shut down gracefully‚Äîvital for production use cases like gRPC, streaming APIs, and long-lived connections. It improves reliability and correctness across the board.

‚úÖ Contribution #2: Fix Premature Session Termination on Empty Responses
PR: Fix premature termination of HTTP/2 sessions when sending empty payload responses (#57808)

üîß Key Changes:

Deferred socket destruction until all pending headers and GOAWAY frames were flushed from nghttp2.

Coordinated lifecycle finalization between JS and C++ layers using callback-based logic.

Used nghttp2_session_want_write/read to safely time session teardown.

Identified and fixed a flaky test (test-http2-client-rststream-before-connect.js) by exposing race conditions.

üìà Impact:

Ensures reliable delivery of GOAWAY and headers, even for empty responses.

Fixes subtle bugs in session lifecycle and improves spec compliance.

Enhances cross-platform test reliability and stability.

üí° Why It Matters:
This fix plugs a hidden edge case where responses with no payload silently dropped essential frames‚Äîcompromising reliability. It also improves internal coordination between JS and C++, making Node.js more production-safe and standards-aligned.
