üß© Node.js Core Contributions ‚Äî HTTP/2 Internals
‚úÖ Contribution #1: Graceful Shutdown of HTTP/2 Sessions
PR: Implement graceful shutdown of HTTP/2 server sessions with proper GOAWAY handling (#57611)

Key Changes:

Introduced kSessions symbol and a SafeSet to track active Http2Session instances.

Added a closeAllSessions() helper to iterate over active sessions and cleanly terminate them.

Updated Http2Server.close() and Http2SecureServer.close() to:

Send GOAWAY frames.

Wait for in-flight streams to complete before tearing down the connection.

Refactored and fixed failing tests to match new lifecycle behavior.

Ensured spec compliance with RFC 7540 ¬ß9.1 and documented alignment with HTTP/1 server .close() semantics.

Impact:

Prevents indefinite process hangs due to lingering HTTP/2 sessions during shutdown.

Rejects new streams post-shutdown initiation, following correct protocol behavior.

Improves server resource management and production reliability.

Introduces a breaking change that aligns with expected, documented behavior.

Why It Matters:
This patch resolves a long-standing issue where HTTP/2 servers in Node.js couldn't shut down cleanly, which is critical in production environments (e.g., gRPC, streaming APIs). It enhances stability and makes graceful termination predictable and spec-compliant.

‚úÖ Contribution #2: Fix Premature Session Termination on Empty Responses
PR: Fix premature termination of HTTP/2 sessions when sending empty payload responses (#57808)

Key Changes:

Deferred socket destruction until all pending headers and GOAWAY frames were fully flushed by nghttp2.

Introduced lifecycle finalization via callback-based coordination between JS and C++ layers.

Used nghttp2_session_want_write/read to safely manage shutdown timing.

Surfaced and fixed a race condition by rewriting flaky test test-http2-client-rststream-before-connect.js.

Impact:

Guarantees reliable delivery of GOAWAY + headers even in edge cases (like empty responses).

Eliminates subtle session lifecycle bugs that could cause premature connection termination.

Improves test reliability and protocol correctness across platforms.

Why It Matters:
This change fixes a subtle but impactful bug that could silently drop HTTP/2 frames during shutdown ‚Äî leading to lost headers and unpredictable behavior. It also strengthens the reliability of Node‚Äôs core networking stack and ensures better compliance with HTTP/2 standards.
